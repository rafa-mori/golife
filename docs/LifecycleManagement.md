# Lifecycle Management

## Introduction

Lifecycle Management in GoLife allows you to define custom execution stages for your processes. This feature provides a structured way to manage the lifecycle of your applications, ensuring that each stage is executed in a controlled and predictable manner.

## Defining Custom Execution Stages

To define custom execution stages, you can use the `DefineStage` method provided by the `LifecycleManager`. Each stage can have its own entry and exit functions, as well as event handlers.

### Example

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"lifecycle"
)

func main() {
	manager := lifecycle.NewLifecycleManager()

	// Define the "start" stage
	manager.DefineStage("start").
		OnEnter(func() { fmt.Println("Server started") }).
		OnExit(func() { fmt.Println("Server stopped") })

	// Define the "processing" stage
	manager.DefineStage("processing").
		OnEvent("request", func(data interface{}) {
			fmt.Println("Processing:", data)
		})

	// Trigger events
	manager.Trigger("processing", "request", "Request 1")
	manager.Trigger("processing", "request", "Request 2")
}
```

In this example, we define two stages: "start" and "processing". The "start" stage has entry and exit functions that print messages when the server starts and stops. The "processing" stage has an event handler for the "request" event, which processes incoming requests.

## Usage Snippets

### Defining a Stage with Entry and Exit Functions

```go
manager.DefineStage("initialize").
	OnEnter(func() { fmt.Println("Initialization started") }).
	OnExit(func() { fmt.Println("Initialization completed") })
```

### Defining a Stage with Event Handlers

```go
manager.DefineStage("execute").
	OnEvent("task", func(data interface{}) {
		fmt.Println("Executing task:", data)
	})
```

### Triggering Events

```go
manager.Trigger("execute", "task", "Task 1")
manager.Trigger("execute", "task", "Task 2")
```

## Conclusion

Lifecycle Management in GoLife provides a powerful way to manage the execution stages of your applications. By defining custom stages and event handlers, you can ensure that your processes are executed in a controlled and predictable manner.
