# Smart Concurrency

## Introduction
The Smart Concurrency feature in GoLife allows for the automatic scaling of workers to handle tasks efficiently. This ensures that your application can handle varying loads without manual intervention.

## Key Features
- **Automatic Scaling**: Workers are automatically scaled based on the load.
- **Efficient Resource Utilization**: Ensures optimal use of CPU and memory.
- **Easy Integration**: Can be easily integrated into your existing workflow.

## Usage Example

### Defining a Stage with Auto-Scaling Workers

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"lifecycle"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	manager := lifecycle.NewLifecycleManager()

	manager.DefineStage("processing").
		AutoScale(5).
		OnEvent("task", func(data interface{}) {
			fmt.Println("Processing task:", data)
		})

	manager.Trigger("processing", "task", "Task 1")
	manager.Trigger("processing", "task", "Task 2")

	time.Sleep(1 * time.Second) // Wait for workers to process
}
```

### Submitting Tasks to the Worker Pool

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"lifecycle"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	manager := lifecycle.NewLifecycleManager()

	manager.DefineStage("processing").
		AutoScale(5).
		OnEvent("task", func(data interface{}) {
			fmt.Println("Processing task:", data)
		})

	manager.Trigger("processing", "task", "Task 1")
	manager.Trigger("processing", "task", "Task 2")

	time.Sleep(1 * time.Second) // Wait for workers to process
}
```

### Waiting for All Tasks to Complete

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"lifecycle"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	manager := lifecycle.NewLifecycleManager()

	manager.DefineStage("processing").
		AutoScale(5).
		OnEvent("task", func(data interface{}) {
			fmt.Println("Processing task:", data)
		})

	manager.Trigger("processing", "task", "Task 1")
	manager.Trigger("processing", "task", "Task 2")

	time.Sleep(1 * time.Second) // Wait for workers to process
}
```

## Conclusion
The Smart Concurrency feature in GoLife provides a robust solution for managing tasks efficiently. By automatically scaling workers, it ensures that your application can handle varying loads without manual intervention. This leads to optimal resource utilization and improved performance.

Try integrating Smart Concurrency into your workflow and experience the benefits of efficient task management!
